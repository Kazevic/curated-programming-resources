# Contributing

Any contribution is much appreciated. However, for pull requests involving adding resources,
I tend to try it and search online about other opinions and recommendations before deciding if I add it,
so it will probably take some time to be added (if at all).

With that said, feel free to file in the issue tracker or submit a pull request for a resource recommendation
or any suggestions for improvement.

Please keep in mind those usually WON'T be accepted:

1. Resources specific to a particular library or framework.

   This resource is currently more oriented towards collecting resources for
   learning programming languages. I unfortunately don't have the time to do a
   thorough evaluation of all the different popular frameworks currently in use.

2. Content behind paywalls.

   I _will_ make multiple exceptions to this rule, especially for books or
   for paid content which has a good number of positive critical reviews.

3. Basically, I need some way of verifying that a given resource is
   high-quality, either by reading it myself or by relying on reviews by others.

Please note that the goal of this collection is to create an annotated list of
high-quality resources suitable for beginners or people wanting to improve their
skill in an existing category. This collection is **not** meant to be an exhaustive
list of every single possible resource, since that might be overwhelming for beginners.

In addition, if you feel that two existing resources are very similar and that
having both of them adds no value, or if one resource is too low-quality, please
open a discussion on the issue tracker.
