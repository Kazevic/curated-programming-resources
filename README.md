# Curated Programming Resources

A [curated and annotated list of resources][resources] for learning
programming and computer science.
Huge thanks to [Michael-0x2a](https://github.com/Michael0x2a) for creating the original list!

## Motivation and goals

Currently, we're living in a sort of "programming renaissance."
Programming and computer science are becoming more popular
than ever—major initiatives like the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us) are popularizing learning programming
across the world, and the number of people interested in majoring in computer science
is [growing](https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/computer-science-now-the-fastest-growing-degree-subject-new-data-reveals) [exponentially](https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/record-numbers-of-students-choose-computer-science-a-level-in-2022).

As a consequence, there are increasingly more resources and tutorials
being produced for beginners who want to learn to code, ranging from books to
online tutorials to interactive websites to massive open online courses (MOOCS) like Codecademy and Coursera.

While this is great, it can also be overwhelming for beginners—there are almost too many resources available,
and it is challenging to figure out where to start.

This page is meant to help solve that problem—to present a **curated** list of resources for people who're either
new to programming, new to a particular topic, or want to advance their skills past the beginner stage.
This page doesn't try and list every single resource available,
but instead links to resources that are guaranteed to be high-quality.
